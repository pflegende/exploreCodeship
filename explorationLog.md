### Configure Your Tests
### Setup Commands
### Please pick your technology and framework. We will prepopulate some basic commands if you choose a specific tech stack. You can modify these commands at any time.

### Select your technology to prepopulate basic commands

___we select (because c was not a proposal and "specific" may be too dificult):___

*Python*

```
# We support all major Python versions. Please see our documentation for a full list.
# https://documentation.codeship.com/basic/languages-frameworks/python/
#
# By default we use the Python version specified in via the PYENV_VERSION environment
# variable and fall back to the latest version from the 2.7 release branch.
#pyenv local 3.6
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
These are the commands that should be run before the tests are executed. Use and modify these commands to load dependencies and prepare the database.
